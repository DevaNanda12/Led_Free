# STM32 Nucleo F446RE LED Blinking with FreeRTOS

This project demonstrates how to blink an onboard LED (connected to pin **PA5**) on the STM32 Nucleo F446RE board using **FreeRTOS**. It creates two concurrent tasks, each toggling the LED at different intervals, showcasing basic RTOS multitasking.

---

## Description

The main program initializes the MCU, sets up system clocks, configures GPIO for the LED pin, and then starts the FreeRTOS scheduler. Two separate tasks are created:

- **defaultTask**: Toggles the LED every 200 milliseconds.
- **LedTask**: Toggles the LED every 1000 milliseconds (1 second).

The tasks run concurrently, causing the LED to toggle at combined intervals as controlled by the RTOS scheduler.

### Key Points of the Code

- **HAL Initialization**: Initializes the hardware abstraction layer and system clocks (using internal HSI oscillator).
- **GPIO Setup**: Configures pin PA5 as push-pull output, initially set LOW.
- **FreeRTOS Setup**:  
  - Two threads/tasks (`defaultTask` and `LedTask`) are created with normal priority and stack size 128 bytes.  
  - The scheduler (`osKernelStart()`) takes control to manage multitasking.
- **Task Functions**:  
  - `StartDefaultTask`: toggles the LED every 200 ms using `HAL_GPIO_TogglePin()` and delays using `osDelay(200)`.  
  - `StartLedTask`: toggles the LED every 1000 ms with a similar approach.
- **Error Handling**: Infinite loop in case of errors.
- **Assertion**: Provides debugging support if full assert is enabled.
